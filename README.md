# Competitive-Programming
This is a repository of all the problems I have solved on Codechef. This repo was created purely for transparency purposes and self learning.

All the code here is meant for self reference and to be referred by others only to learn the implementation. Do not use this repository to copy the code directly, but instead to compare it with yours.

If you have a better algorithm or code for any of the problems posted here, do **PR**, I'll add it right in.
